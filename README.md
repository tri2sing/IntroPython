Note:

In case you do not want to have global environment variables for proxy setting.

To have PyCharm communicate with https://github.com from behind the firewall.

    1) Launch a command shell

    2) Set http_proxy and https_proxy environment variables in the shell

    4) Launch PyCharm from  the shell where environment variables were set

    4) Ensure that PyCharm settings do not use proxy
