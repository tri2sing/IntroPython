IntroPython
===========

This repo contains code samples for a two day Introductory Python class that I offered at Intel.

The broad outline of course follows:

    HelloWorld

    Variables

    Operators

    Functions01

    Functions02

    Functions03

    Loops

    CmdLineArgs1

    CmdLineArgs2


Note:

To have PyCharm communicate with https://github.com from behind the firewall.

    1) Open up command shell

    2) Set http_proxy and https_proxy environment variables

    3) Launch a command shell

    4) Launch PyCharm from inside the shell

    4) Ensure that PyCharm is set to not use proxy
